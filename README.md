Data Analysis Project in SQL 
----------------------------

This project is the second part of a bigger SQL  Portfolio Project, which aims to stand as a showcase of knowledge and implementation of SQL processes and procedures in Data Analytics & Engineering.

After the completion of the Data Warehouse Project, the final model of the Database, is consisted of three Tables with the type of Views. 
This model is considered bussiness friendly and it is adjusted on the needs of todays most useful and demanding practices in Data Exploratory & Analysis.

Firstly, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to get familiar with the Data and find the key values & tendencies, on which a further analysis will be prepared. 
As a second step, more advanced analytics are implemented to show all the useful bussiness insights, that are necessary for smart and right decisions.

These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more. 
This repository contains SQL queries designed to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database.

Eventually, a full bussiness report is built, based on all those processes. This report can finally be used in a BI tool to create a dashboard for the stakeholders and the managers of the bussiness.
